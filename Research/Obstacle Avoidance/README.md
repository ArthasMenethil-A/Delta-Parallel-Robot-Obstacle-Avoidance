## 1. Springer Handbook of Robotics: Chapter 35 - Motion Planning and Obstacle Avoidance
------
This chapter describes motion planning and obstacle avoidance for **mobile robots**.

### 1.1 From Motion Planning to Obstacle Avoidance
------
Up to now we have described motion planning techniques. Their objective is to compute a collision-free trajectory to the target configuration that complies with the vehicle constraints. They assume a **perfect model** of the robot and scenario. The advantage of these techniques is that they provide complete and **global solutions** of the problem. Nevertheless, **when the surroundings are unknown and unpredictable, these techniques fail**.

### 1.2 Definition of Obstacle Avoidance

The obstacle avoidance problem consists of computing a motion control that avoid collisions wtih the obstacles gathered by the sensors, whilst driving the robot towards the target location. The result of applying this technique at each time is a sequence of motions that drive the vehicle free of collisions to the target.
